# Quicksort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) version of quicksort. Use the
template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some
basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

Hint: To make qicksort iterative, think about the part of the array each
recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

In the worst-case scenario, the partition function consistently picks the smallest or largest element as the pivot, resulting in unbalanced partitions. This would lead to one partition with n-1 elements and the other with 0 elements, effectively reducing the size of the problem by only one element on each recursive call.
In this scenario, the worst-case time complexity is still $\Theta$ (n^2)
